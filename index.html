                meri pyaari ananyaa, thinking about you brings me inexplicable joy. both inside, outside, and all around, 
                you radiate with an ethereal beauty that no mythical creature has ever had. sweetheart, 
                not once in my life i had no one to write to in such great depth. i care about you so 
                much that i wouldn’t mind being called your fool, after all, you are the most valued woman in my world.
                waise.. if i end up losing my job mein toh tumhare pass hi aajunga for money.
            </p>
            <p>
                i know today is not your birthday, neither is it something special... it's just
                that i can't stop myself from loving youuu and i'm enjoying writing every single
                word as to how much i love you and how much you mean to me. put it simply, you mean
                the world to me but ofc i wanna express it even more than that, idiot. likee... yaarrr
                mein pagal hojaunga tumhare pyaar mein. like i'm a total senseless idiot right now.
            </p>

            <p>
                i'm madly, deeply, truly in love with you. and i am not one of those people who deny 
                themselves the simple pleasure of telling the truth. darling you have taught me so many
                things in life. trust me when i say that the joy i get from spending time with you,
                even in my thoughts, is simply the best thing I have ever experienced. it's just funny
                as to how it all turned out, at first, it was just a liking, but soon enough 
                it turned into deep love without me even realizing it.
            </p>

            <p>
                i can’t get enough of your name on my tongue, neither can I seem to get my eyes off from you.
                gazing into the starry sky in your eyes is all i want to do for the rest of my life.
                i'm in love with every single thing about you. someone as priceless as you deserve only the 
                finest things that life has to offer. seeing you happy is all I care about.. when i say this, 
                i mean every single word of it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                if i could start counting all my blessing, falling for you
                will be the first one on the list. i mean meeting you was the beginning of a 360 degrees 
                turnaround for my life. i have become humble and accomplished ever since you came around.
                my existence revolves around you, so it would be impossible for anyone or anything else to 
                take your place. on this ordinary day, i promise to love you with everything i have and 
                cherish you for as long as you would allow me to.
            </p>

            <p>
                i'll always be by your side. when you are upset, when you feel like crying i'll lend you a shoulder.
                when you are sad... so am I, when you are hurt i get an even deeper cut in my heart
                if you want to scream i'll be right next to you screaming along.
                i'll stay by your side.. till the darkness passes, till the storm is through,
                ain't no way i'm leaving you... for you have come a long way out alone all by yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
                ufff... yaar i can't stop myself from writing but have to now. toh suno stupid pagal pyaaari ananyaa, 
                finally just wanted to say ki i might not be myself in the future due some or other reason. it's exactly
                then i want you to remember that, IDIOT, beacause i'm unable to get a hold of myself doesn't mean that
                you won't be my bestie anymore. just ping me using name, and i promise, no matter what shit of a situation
                i'll be in, I'LL COME RUNNING, for you mean the world to me, cutieee!!
            </p>
